# cardano-rewards-calculator
A basic calculator that uses the csv's generated by daedalus that 
lets you know your yearly interest rate and total rewards 
(sum of all wallets). It also tells you the difference between different days - 
For this functionality it assumes that you have 1 csv for each epoch.

USAGE:

fill in the parameters for the day that you began staking (DATE_OF_FIRST_STAKE_REWARD), 
total ADA staked (ORIGINAL_ADA_SUM) and your windows username (USERNAME). 

The program assumes that you used the default folder to store the csv files.
